<p>Drug Target Ontology (DTO) is being developed at the University of Miami in the research group of Stephan Schürer. DTO is supported by grant <a href="http://www.rdatlas.com/portal/portal.cfm?page=grants&amp;applicationid=8933011" target="_blank">U54CA189205</a> (Illuminating the Druggable Genome Knowledge Management Center, Oprea, PI) awarded by the NCI through the NIH Common Fund. It is a component of the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project (<a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/idg" target="_blank">https://commonfund.nih.gov/idg</a>).
  
  The DTO project develops a novel semantic framework to formalize knowledge about drug targets with a focus on the current IDG protein families. The DTO is developed as a reference for drug targets with the longer-term goal to create a community standard that will facilitate the integration of diverse drug discovery information from numerous heterogeneous resources.  The first version of the DTO consists of asserted class hierarchies of the four IDG protein families, GPCRs, kinases, ion channels, and nuclear hormone receptors. Protein classes are linked to tissue and disease via different levels of confidence. DTO also contains drug target development classifications, a large collection of cell lines from the LINCS project and relevant cell-disease and cell-tissue relations. DTO is modeled in OWL2-DL to enable further classification by inference reasoning and SPARQL queries.  DTO is implemented following a modularization approach. The currently version of IDG contains approximately 13,000 classes and > 190,000 axioms. DTO will serve as the organizational framework for drug targets in the IDG PHAROS User Interface Portal (<a href="https://pharos.nih.gov" target="_blank">https://pharos.nih.gov</a>).  </p>
